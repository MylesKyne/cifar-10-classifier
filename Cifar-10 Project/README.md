# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

The goal was to build a model that can accurately distinguish between these image classes using deep learning techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **CIFAR-10** is a well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes.
- The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## ðŸ§  Model Features
- Deep CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers
- ReLU activation and dropout for regularization
- Trained over multiple epochs with early stopping or learning rate scheduling
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- matlab

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/myleskyne/cifar10-classifier.git
